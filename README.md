# Capacitor "Kitchen Sink" Demo App

An (intentionally) simple Ionic Angular app demonstrating how to use all of the [Capacitor Core Plugins](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis). 
Each plugin page provides a description of the plugin, a link to the Capacitor docs, and example code that runs on the web, iOS, 
and Android.

## How to Use

* Install Capacitor's [Required Dependencies](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/getting-started/dependencies).
* Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-plugin-demo
* Continue onto next instructions

## Running on the Web

From a Terminal, change directory into this project (`cd capacitor-plugin-demo`) then run the following:

```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic build
$ ionic serve
```

## Running on iOS

Coming soon

## Running on Android

## About Capacitor

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/) is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web. 
It provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible, 
while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them. 
Adding native functionality is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.

Capacitor is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps 
to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has [backwards-compatible support](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/cordova/using-cordova-plugins) 
for many existing Cordova plugins.
